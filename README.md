### overview ###

code related to ingesting bell-gallery images into the bdr.


### normal ingest flow ###

- get metadata
    - metadata should be for _all_ the records
    - from having all the metadata, the code can determine what image-&-metadata additions to make, what metadata-only additions to make, and make corrections to existing bdr metadata
    - status:
        - done; added to git 2017-06-26
            - `a__all_data_raw.xml`
            - `b__all_data_formatted.xml`

- get access to image-directory
    - check desktop access
        - status: done 2017-06-26
    - check dev `mount` access
        - status: done 2017-06-26

- convert raw filemaker-pro xml to json
    - foundation/acc_num_to_data.py
    - end result: `c__accession_number_to_data_dict.json`
    - status:
        - done 2017-06-26
        - redone 2017-06-29 with J.C.'s corrections

- run script to get list of files in the images-to-ingest directory
    - utils/make_image_list.py
    - end result: `d__bell_images_listing.json`
    - status:
        - done 2017-06-27
        - redone 2017-06-29 with J.C.'s corrections

- compare imagefile-filenames to metadata-filenames
    - utils/check_filenames_against_metadata.py
        - NOTE: update the line:

                filenames_subset = self.filter_filenames( filenames_dct, [ '.22', '.tif', '.tiff' ] )  # from manual inspection of d__bell_images_listing.json

            ...with the appropriate suffixes from the d__bell_images_listing - 'extension_types'

        - NOTE: code _will_ count as a 'find' an image-filename ending in, say, '.tif', even if, in c__accession_number....json, the filename does _not_ contain that extension.

    - end result: `data/d2__images_metadata_comparison.json` -- work through any not-matched files with J.C. before proceeding.
    - work:
        - emailed J.C. list of non-matches 2017-06-28
        - 38 image-directory filenames were found in the metadata
        - 67 image-directory filenames were not found in the metadata.
        - got a new file from J.C., reran matching and after one manual imgage filename corection are all set.
    - status: idone 2017-06-29.

- match metadata accession-numbers to pid #1
    - foundation/acc_num_to_pid.py
    - end result: `e__accession_number_to_pid_dict.json` file containing a dict of accession-numbers-to-pids.
    - accession-numbers without pids imply creation of a new metadata-only object (which may gain an associated image later)
    - accession-numbers with pids imply checking to see if fedora metadata needs to be updated
    - status:
        - run 2017-06-28; shows 97 accession-numbers without pids
        - rerun 2017-06-29 after new metadata file from J.C.; shows 97 accession-numbers without pids (one changed pid from previous list)
        - done 2017-07-03 -- no acession numbers without pids.

- make metadata-only list
    - tasks/metadata.run_metadata_only_lister()
    - to run (from `bell_code` directory)...

            >>> from tasks import metadata
            >>> metadata.run_metadata_only_lister()

    - end result: `f__metadata_only_accession_numbers.json`
    - status:
        - run 2017-06-29
        - rerun 2017-06-29 after new metadata file from J.C.
        - done: rerun 2017-07-03 -- now shows, appropriately, none

- create new metadata objects
    - tasks/metadata.run_enqueue_create_metadata_only_jobs()

    - to run (from `bell_code` directory)...

            >>> from tasks import metadata
            >>> metadata.run_enqueue_create_metadata_only_jobs()

    - to confirm that object is in fedora:
            https://api_search/?q=mods_id_bell_accession_number_ssim:the%20accession_number

    - after creates, confirm a re-run of `foundation/acc_num_to_pid.py` results in zero non-pid matches.
        - note that this re-run will update, as it should, `e__accession_number_to_pid_dict.json` -- the dict of accession-numbers-to-pids.
    - status: done 2017-07-03
        - also reran prep scripts to confirm that all accession-numbers have bdr pids

- make image-filename to data dct
    - produces a dct and then json file like:

            {
            u'Zorn PR_1971.705.tif': {u'accession_number': u'PR 1971.705',
                                      u'pid': u'bdr:301594'},
            u'Zorn PR_1971.709.tif': {u'accession_number': u'PR 1971.709',
                                      u'pid': u'bdr:301595'}
            }

    - script: tasks/images.run_make_image_filename_dct()
    - to run (from `bell_code` directory)...

            >>> from tasks import images
            >>> images.run_make_image_filename_dct()

    - end result: `fg__images_filename_dct.json`
        - note that at the bottom of that file are any files that were excluded from the filename-dct.
    - status: done, 2017-07-05.


- make list of images to process
    - tasks/images.ImageLister.make_image_lists()

    - to run (from `bell_code` directory)...

            >>> from tasks import images
            >>> images.run_make_image_lists()

    - produces a file containing both a list of images to add, and a list of images to update
    - end result: `g_images_to_process.json`
    - status: done: 2017-07-05

- add new images
    - tasks/images.run_enqueue_add_image_jobs()
    - to run (from `bell_code` directory)...

            >>> from tasks import images
            >>> images.run_enqueue_add_image_jobs()

    - for adding individual images, if necessary: tasks/images.run_add_image( filename_dct )
    - status: done 2017-07-06

- TODO: make sure jpg images get an image/jpeg mimetype in Fedora
    - add a code step that verifies the mimetype in Fedora

- add updated images
    - tasks/images.run_enqueue_add_image_jobs()
    - to run (from `bell_code` directory)...

            >>> from tasks import images
            >>> images.run_enqueue_update_image_jobs()

    - for adding individual images, if necessary: tasks/images.run_add_image( filename_dct )
    - status: done 2017-07-21

- purge caches for updated images
    - loris cache (info, source, derivatives) - DONE 8/1/2017
    - thumbnail in fedora & django cache - DONE 8/1/2017

- TODO
    - check all images have MASTER & JP2 datastreams (not TIFF, ...)
    - check MASTER & JP2 headers: should have a filename, content type for JP2s, ... (HEAD request works for this)

- update the custom-solr-index
    - 2017-07-21 WAITING FOR RESPONSE TO BIRKIN'S EMAIL ABOUT JSON FILE
    - 2017-08-04: looking at a different way of doing this:
        - get access to all the custom metadata (based on accession number): c__accession_number_to_data_dict.json looks like it
        - get all pids that match the accession number: e__accession_number_to_pid_dict.json looks like what we want
        - build records to post to solr (in json file format so we could just send that to them in the future)
        - delete everything in custom solr index
        - post new records
    - make solr pids list
        - tasks/indexer.run_make_solr_pids_list()
        - end result: j__solr_pids_list.json
        - note: h__x.json & i__x.json were files that are no longer needed
        - status: done 2017-08-04
    - create solr data file
        - tasks/indexer.run_create_solr_data()
        - end result: k__data_for_solr.json
        - status: done 2017-08-07
    - OLD -- TEMPORARY, FOR REFERENCE....
        - prep list of pids from custom-index
            - tasks/indexer.run_make_pids_for_custom_index()
            - end result: `h__pids_from_custom_index_list.json`
            - status: done: 2016-05-26
        - prep pids-to-delete list
            - tasks/indexer.run_make_delete_pids_list()
            - end result: `i__custom_index_delete_pids.json`
            - review that list
            - status: done 2016-05-26
        - prep pids-to-update list
            - tasks/indexer.run_make_update_pids_list()
            - adds pid to accession-number-to-data-dct data.
            - end result: `j__custom_index_update_data_list.json`
            - status: done, 2016-05-26
        - run updates
            - tasks/indexer.run_enqueue_index_jobs()
            - end result: `k__entries_updated_tracker.json`
            - status: done! 2016-05-26
        - run deletes
            - tasks/indexer.run_solr_deletions()
            - end result: `l__solr_pids_deleted_tracker.json`
            - 2016-05-26 note: not sure what this step was; there is no function 'indexer.run_delete_pids()'
                - I think this is a TODO. I spot-checked some of the entries in i__custom_index_delete_pids.json, and they're not in the [custom bell solr index](http://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/bell/?q=*:*&wt=json). So, this may have referred to planned code to delete old pids from **fedora**. For example, one of the entries in that delete_pids list is 'bdr:299542'. That [still appears in the bdr](https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:299542/), but not the custom bell solr index. A search on that title shows that the new record, with [pid 'bdr:650784' is in the bdr](https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/search/?utf8=âœ“&q=Untitled+%5BSaint+and+Child+and+Crucifixion+%5D), and that pid _is_, appropriately in the updated custom bell gallery solr index.
                - Note: usually when an image is added to a metadata-only record, a new pid is not created. New pids can be created when the bell 'accession-number' changes -- and a handful do regularly change with each ingestion, because of bell staff corrections.
            - 2016-Oct-20: in response to J.C. recent emails, realized indexer deletes not done.
            - status: done, 2016-Oct-25

- delete old bell items from fedora
    - 2016-Oct-20: in response to J.C. recent emails, should write code to delete non-source-data entries from fedora. TODO.
    - steps:
        - validate that the original-data count matches the custom-solr doc-count.
            - `from tasks import cleanup; cleanup.run_validate_solr_counts()`
            - status: done, 2016-Nov-01
        - validate that all original-data accession-numbers are in the bell custom solr-index.
            - `from tasks import cleanup; cleanup.run_validate_solr_accession_numbers()`
            - status: done, 2016-Nov-02
        - validate that all original-data pids are in the bell custom solr-index.
            - `from tasks import cleanup; cleanup.run_validate_solr_pids()`
            - status: done, 2016-Nov-02
        - make list of bdr pids to delete.
            - NOTE: do the deletion accession number check as early as possible
            - NOTE: check whether an object to delete has an image - just update the metadata?
            - `from tasks import cleanup; cleanup.run_make_bdr_pids_to_delete()`
            - end result: `m__bdr_delete_pids.json`
            - status: done, 2016-Nov-03
        - run deletion.
            - `from tasks import cleanup; cleanup.run_delete_single_pid_from_bdr( pid )`
            - end result: `n__bdr_entries_deleted_tracker.json`
            - status: most done weeks ago, did last four from emailing J.C. 2016-Nov-29

- run bdr validation
    - validate that all original-data pids are in the bdr.
    - validate that all original-data accession-numbers are in the bdr.

- run solr validation
    - validate that all original-data pids are in the the custom solr index.
    - validate that all original-data accession-numbers are in the custom solr index.

- let Bell-J.C. & CIS-J.O. know when done
    - old status: done, 2016-05-26

- TODO verify objects to delete, if they have images
    - if an accession number changes, then we would see that as a new object
    - then the old object (with the old accession number) would need to be deleted
    - if that object to be deleted has an image, then we might lose the image, because she wouldn't send us the image if it wasn't updated.
    - so, any items to delete with an image - check with her.
    - and do this process before we even create any metadata objects.

- TODO update future flow...
    - run initial bdr validation
    - run bdr cleanup
    - run rest of bdr validation
    - update solr index
    - run solr validation

### feb 2017 J.C. followup ###

- J.C. question originally from jan 12, 2017

- reported issue...

    - [CIS webiste Schrager search](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/arts/bell-gallery/collection?quick=schrager) contains 10 items with 4 duplicates

        - The 4 duplicate CIS images appear to have accession numbers that are not currently valid (perhaps they were in the past).
        - I'm guessing that the internal index that the CIS website uses did not remove the old entries when it added the new ones.

    - [BDR Schrager search](https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/search/?search_field=&q=schrager+%22bell+gallery%22) contains 8 works, 6 by Schrager and 2 containing metadata for duplicate Schrager's and images from another artist Bill Jacobson

        - odd, internally I have the correct Jacobson metadata for the two Jacobson images -- I cannot see how incorrect metadata was applied
        - emailing J.C. about this and CIS issue 24 feb 2017.
        - I did pass on the correct info to the bell-custom-solr index!

### Some solr-pub calls for reference...

- [get list of pids](https://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/bell/?q=*:*&fl=pid&wt=json&indent=2&start=0&rows=10000)

- [search accession-number](https://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/bell/?q=PH%201998.24&wt=json&indent=2)
- [search pid](https://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/bell/?q=%22bdr:299010%22&wt=json&indent=2)

---

### TODOs...

- modernize logging
- re-architecting settings -- perhaps `prep_env_settings.sh`, `dev_env_settings.sh`, `prod_env_settings.sh`
- add to init.d rq-worker start-stop-status script
- consider validating mods before sending it to api (tho api does validate it )
- investigate indexing of metadata-only objects; specifically, object_type is 'undetermined' instead of 'CommonMetadata'
    - note: rels_content_model_ssim is now correct.
